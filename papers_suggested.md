## Suggested Papers (Jan 2023 - )

**If you have papers in mind, please post it on Slack first.** The reading group Tzar will compile them and post them here.

#### Generative GaitNet
* **Lead:** Guanxiong Chen
* **Authors:** Jungnam Park, Sehee Min, Phil Sik Chang, Jaedong Lee, Moon Seok Park, and Jehee Lee.
* **Venue:** SIGGRAPH 2022
* **Reasons:**
    * Learning-based human musculoskeletal model control
    * Places emphasis on analyzing "anatomy" conditions + gait conditions
* [**Paper**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3528233.3530717)
* [**Code**](https://github.com/namjohn10/GenerativeGaitNet) 

#### We are More than Our Joints: Predicting how 3D Bodies Move
* **Lead:** Niloofar Khoshsiyar
* **Authors:** Zhang, Yan and Black, Michael J and Tang, Siyu
* **Venue:** CVPR 2021
* **Reasons:**
    * From Michael J Black's group
* [**Paper**](https://yz-cnsdqz.github.io/eigenmotion/MOJO/index.html/)

#### Synthesizing Long-Term 3D Human Motion and Interaction in 3D Scenes
* **Lead:** Niloofar Khoshsiyar
* **Authors:** Jiashun Wang, Huazhe Xu, Jingwei Xu, Sifei Liu, Xiaolong Wang
* **Venue:** CVPR 2021
* **Reasons:**
* [**Paper**](https://jiashunwang.github.io/Long-term-Motion-in-3D-Scenes/)

#### Deep learning of biomimetic sensorimotor control for biomechanical human animation
* **Lead:** Guanxiong Chen
* **Authors:** Masaki Nakada, Tao Zhou, Honglin Chen, Tomer Weiss, and Demetri Terzopoulos
* **Venue:** ToG 2018
* **Reasons:**
    * Cited many of Dinesh's papers. So I guess quite relevant?
